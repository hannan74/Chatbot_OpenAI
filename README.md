# Chatbot_OpenAI
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot using OpenAI's GPT models. It leverages FAISS vector store for fast document retrieval and fine-tunes the model using custom training data to improve response accuracy. The chatbot can interact with users and provide information based on a provided knowledge base.
